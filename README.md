# Discover Buenos Aires 🌆  
[🔗 Live Demo](https://programacion-web-ecru.vercel.app/)

This is a web development project I created for a university course, where we learned the fundamentals of building functional websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🌍 Project Overview

The website is designed as a **tourism platform** that highlights different cultural and historical tours across Buenos Aires. It includes sections for iconic landmarks, recommended routes, and visitor information — all presented in a clean and accessible format.

## 🎯 Purpose

I chose this project because I’m passionate about the **history and cultural richness of Buenos Aires**, my home city. I believe that design and technology can help bring local stories to a broader audience, and I wanted to create something that reflects that idea.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content  
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, responsive design  
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic behavior

## 📦 How to Run It Locally

If you prefer to test it on your own machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicolereiman/Programacion_Web_Reiman.git
cd Programacion_Web_Reiman
open index.html
```

🚀 Future Ideas
I would love to expand this project by:

Adding a backend for tour reservations

Including interactive maps with user geolocation

Translating the site to reach international visitors
