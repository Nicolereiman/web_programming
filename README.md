# Discover Buenos Aires 🌆  
[🔗 Live Demo](https://programacion-web-ecru.vercel.app/)

TuriBA is a web development project I created for a university course, where we learned the fundamentals of building functional websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🌍 Project Overview

TThe site allows users to explore guided tours in different neighborhoods of **Buenos Aires**, including San Telmo, Palermo, and Recoleta. Visitors can read descriptions, make tour reservations, and submit user reviews.

The design is fully responsive and aimed at enhancing accessibility to the cultural and historical richness of the city.


## 🎯 Purpose

I chose this project because I’m passionate about the **history and cultural richness of Buenos Aires**, my home city. I believe that design and technology can help bring local stories to a broader audience, and I wanted to create something that reflects that idea.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content  
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, responsive design  
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic behavior

## Live Preview

## 📦 How to Run It Locally

If you prefer to test it on your own machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nicolereiman/Programacion_Web_Reiman.git
cd Programacion_Web_Reiman
open index.html
```

## Future Ideas
I would love to expand this project by:

Adding a backend for tour reservations

Including interactive maps with user geolocation

Translating the site to reach international visitors
